## Attendance

* Tim
* Pratik

## Big O (and stuff)

* Worked through Big O problems from cracking the coding interview.
* Particularly focused on the tree-like expansion of certain problems
  * recursive especially
  * and how the best way to calculate runtime for those sorts of problems starts with asking:
    * how tall is the tree
    * and how much work is done at each node
*
