### Prob

* combination
* poisson
* bayes theorem
  * >Facebook has a content team that labels pieces of content on the platform as spam or not spam. 90% of them are diligent raters and will label 20% of the content as spam and 80% as non-spam. The remaining 10% are non-diligent raters and will label 0% of the content as spam and 100% as non-spam. Assume the pieces of content are labeled independently from one another, for every rater. Given that a rater has labeled 4 pieces of content as good, what is the probability that they are a diligent rater?
* coin flip
  * (p value, is it fair)
* binomial
  * >Probability a series goes into 7 games?
* probability formulas
  * single, joint, conditional
* probability tree
  * >What is the probability that 𝐻𝐻 occurs before 𝑇𝐻 in an infinite sequence of coin flips?
