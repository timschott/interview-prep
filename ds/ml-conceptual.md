* when to use classification vs regression?
  * classification separates data into camps of categorical labels
  * regression classifies based on a numerical attribute
* what is F1?
  * harmonic mean of precision and recall
* what is precision?
  * number of true positives / true positives + false positives
* what is recall?

* what is overfitting?
  * overfitting means a model has learned its parameters too specifically to your particular data set which means it is not going to be able to effectively generalize to unseen data
  * how to address?
    * regulariazation
    * more training data
    * parameter tuning
* what is underfitting?
  * underfitting means a model has not effectively learned parameters to model your particular data set so it is not accurately solving your problem of interest
  * how to address?
    * more training data
    * more complex model
    * ensemble learning
* what is bootstrapping?
  * iteratively resampling your dataset in order to estimate population metrics
  * when to use it?
    * very useful when you have a constrained/limited sized dataset but still want to carry out advanced analysis
* what is a loss function?
  * 
* what is ensemble learning?
  * what is bagging?
* how do you discover outliers in your data?
