<p align="center">I met a traveller from an antique land,</p>
<p align="center">Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</p>
<p align="center">Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,</p>
<p align="center">Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</p>
<p align="center">And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</p>
<p align="center">Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</p>
<p align="center">Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</p>
<p align="center">The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</p>
<p align="center"><p align="center">And on the pedestal, these words appear:</p>
<p align="center">My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</p>
<p align="center">Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</p>
<p align="center">Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</p>
<p align="center">Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</p>
<p align="center">The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
